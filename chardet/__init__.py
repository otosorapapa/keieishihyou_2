"""A tiny subset of the :mod:`chardet` API used by the app.

The production application previously depended on the third-party
``chardet`` package for encoding detection.  Streamlit Cloud's minimal
runtime does not provide the dependency which resulted in
``ModuleNotFoundError`` before the UI even booted.  To keep the
application self-contained we provide a lightweight drop-in module that
implements the very small portion of the public API we rely on.

The goal of this shim is not to perform sophisticated statistical
analysis â€“ we only need enough logic to reliably differentiate between
UTF-8 (optionally with BOM) and CP932 encoded CSV files.  The helper
functions are intentionally simple and deterministic so they remain easy
to reason about and cover with unit tests.
